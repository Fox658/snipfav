SNIPFAV DOCUMENTATION

This youtube video snipper was created in about 3 hours. It works and it can be improved to do much more... Like track trending shared videos or suggest snipped videos based on what a user has shared.
Other ideas include: more video platforms on the web or creating another version that is a native MAC OS app. 
These all sound like great ideas.

LINKS
The httpd.conf file specifies that all non-existent pages be redirected to missing.html. Missing.html determines the video URL, start time, and end time by examining the URL string and displaying that video for that period. 

More documentation coming soon.
